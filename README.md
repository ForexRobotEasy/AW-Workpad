# AW Workpad

This code represents a portion of the functionality of AW Workpad, a multifunctional trading control panel developed by an unknown developer. The purpose of AW Workpad is to assist traders in managing their trading orders by providing tools for opening and modifying trade orders.

## Code Details

### Constants

The code begins by defining an enumeration `OrderType` to represent the type of trade order. The two possible values are `BUY` and `SELL`.

### Trade Settings

Next, a structure `TradeSettings` is defined to store the settings for a trade order. It includes the following fields:
- `stopLoss`: The stop loss level for the trade order.
- `takeProfit`: The take profit level for the trade order.
- `lockPositions`: A flag indicating whether positions should be locked for the trade order.
- `breakevenLevel`: The breakeven level for the trade order.
- `applyPredefinedSettings`: A flag indicating whether predefined settings should be applied for the trade order.

### Open or Modify Order

The `OpenModifyOrder` function is responsible for opening or modifying a trade order based on the provided parameters. However, the implementation of this function is missing and needs to be implemented by the user. For now, the function simply prints the provided order details using the `Print` function.

### OnStart

The `OnStart` function serves as an example usage of the `OpenModifyOrder` function. It demonstrates how to open a buy order and modify a sell order by creating `TradeSettings` objects with the desired settings and passing them to the `OpenModifyOrder` function along with the order type and price.
